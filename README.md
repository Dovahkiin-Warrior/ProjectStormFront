# H1 PROJECT STORMFRONT ALPHA SERIES

<b>Welcome to Project: StormFront Alpha. This is a Source 2013 mod that is developed by the kind staff of FireHostRedux.net in which the player survives tornadoes.
The plans for this mod are not currently complete, and they may very over time; hence why it is an alpha mod. The sole purpose of this mod is to give the player a realistic tornado survival experience.
Future versions of this mod will include the ability to properly storm chase, the ability to be killed by falling objects, the ability to be struck by lightning, and so much more.

Creation of this mod was inspired by ThePlagueMistress/LittleDemonCrow of FireHostRedux, in which was done when she remarkably quoted "This map is too laggy and I can't run it." when we were running an experimental map known as "The Tornado Engine".
Continued updates and development are brought to you courtesy of FireHostRedux.net, their partners, and friends.
