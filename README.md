<h1>PROJECT STORMFRONT ALPHA SERIES</h1>

<b>Welcome to Project: StormFront Alpha. This is a Source 2013 mod that is developed by the kind staff of FireHostRedux.net in which the player survives tornadoes.
The plans for this mod are not currently complete, and they may very over time; hence why it is an alpha mod. The sole purpose of this mod is to give the player a realistic tornado survival experience.
Future versions of this mod will include the ability to properly storm chase, the ability to be killed by falling objects, the ability to be struck by lightning, and so much more.
</b>

<h1> HOW TO PLAY </h1>
<b>First off, install <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_SDK_2013">Source SDK 2013 Multiplayer</a> (You will need to click Multiplayer to install it directly from this wiki page).
